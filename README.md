## Project Requirement by the International Relations Office of the University of Peradeniya

Quote

-
We have planned to develop a Dashboard for our website to indicate the MoUs/Grants and the process of taking approvals, including its current status, which would be beneficial for all the MoU Coordinators/ Grant Holders as well as for other academic and non-academic staff.

## Importance of MOUs and Knowing where the MOU request is at the moment
 
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) may include, for example, a commitment to explore the potential for:
- co-operation on new or existing academic programmes
- the development of joint research activities
- staff exchange or mutual visits to both institutions
- student exchange
- the exchange of information in the form of publications and journals, reference materials and other results of teaching and research activities.

The international relations office of the University of Peradeniya has about 100 partners, from various foreign countries, 
1.Australia			2.Austria			3.Belgium
4.Bhutan 			5.Cambodia			6.Canada 
7.China			8.Czech Republic		9.Ethiopia

25.South Korea		26.Switzerland		27.United States
28.Thailand			29.Turkey			30.Uganda

Most of these partners are higher education institutions based in the countries mentioned above. Therefore the importance of having a legal document in a proper way is a necessity.
Other than that, the time taken for the signing of MOUs due to lack of communication can be reduced by updating the website in a more user-friendly nature towards MOUs. Furthermore, some international educational institutes provide educational opportunities to undergraduates and fresh graduates with deadlines and other documentation, so the signing of MOUs in a quick session will become beneficial for InRO UOP, undergraduates and staff who are interested in applying for the opportunities.
